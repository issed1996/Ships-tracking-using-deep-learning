# Ships-tracking-using-deep-learning
Ships detection and tracking using deep learning algorithms :starting from a benchmark yolov5 large 
we want to implement new detection algorihms and the  compare them in term of accruracy (MAP) and inference speed (FPS)
so  we can implement some of them on a raspberry pi 4 in our cameras stations.
